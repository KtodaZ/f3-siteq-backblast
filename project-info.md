# Face Recognition Service - Project Specification

## Project Overview

Build a cloud-based web service that identifies people by name in uploaded photos using machine learning face recognition technology. The system should learn from user input and improve accuracy over time.

## Project Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Create a web GUI where users can upload photos and automatically identify people by name
- **Learning System**: Improve recognition accuracy as more photos are labeled with names
- **User Training**: Allow users to assign names to unknown faces and build a face database
- **Confidence Matching**: Show confidence levels for face matches and handle ambiguous results
- **Multi-Match Handling**: Present multiple potential matches when system is uncertain

## Target Users & Scale

- **Organization Type**: Small organization
- **User Count**: ~20 users
- **Photo Source**: Mobile uploads
- **Photo Composition**: Group photos with 15-20 people per image
- **Processing Volume**: Estimated 1,000+ photos monthly

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- **Processing Time**: Under 2 minutes per photo
- **Response Time**: Real-time UI feedback during processing
- **Accuracy Priority**: High accuracy preferred over speed

### Photo Conditions
- **Lighting**: Low light conditions expected
- **Accessories**: Support people wearing hats or glasses
- **Exclusions**: Unlikely to have sunglasses
- **Format**: Mobile photo uploads (various formats/resolutions)

### Infrastructure Constraints
- **Hosting Preference**: Vercel (but open to alternatives)
- **Budget**: Cost-conscious approach, prefer free tiers where possible
- **Architecture**: Cloud-based storage and processing
- **Scalability**: Design for small organization scale

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Core Face Recognition
**Primary Choice: AWS Rekognition**
- Latest Version 7 with 80% better accuracy
- Built-in face learning through user vectors
- Supports up to 100 faces per image
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Cost: ~$1.50/month after free tier

**Alternative: Azure Face API**
- 90-95% accuracy rating
- Lower API costs than AWS
- PersonGroup feature for multiple face samples
- Requires Microsoft approval for access

### Hosting & Infrastructure
**Recommended: AWS Infrastructure**
- Vercel incompatible due to 10-second function timeouts
- AWS Lambda for API processing
- S3 for photo storage
- Total estimated cost: $30-50/month

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Rekognition
                     ↓
         S3 Storage ← Database ← Redis Cache
```

### Database Solution
**Primary: PostgreSQL with pgvector**
- Cost-effective at $25/month vs $70/month for Pinecone
- Sufficient performance for <10,000 faces
- Standard SQL with vector search capabilities

**Caching: Redis**
- Sub-millisecond face encoding retrieval
- 2-day retention for active lookups
- Significant performance boost for repeated queries

### Frontend Framework
**Recommended: Svelte/SvelteKit**
- 30% faster mobile load times vs React
- 1.7KB bundle sizes for mobile optimization
- Compile-time optimization benefits

**Mobile Considerations:**
- PWA camera access limitations on iOS
- Requires Safari browser, not installed PWA
- Implement dual manifest approach for cross-platform

## System Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Photo Upload Interface**
   - Drag-and-drop or mobile camera capture
   - Progress indicators during processing
   - Batch upload support

2. **Face Detection & Recognition**
   - Automatic face detection in group photos
   - Recognition against known face database
   - Confidence scoring for each match

3. **User Training Interface**
   - Unknown face labeling system
   - Name assignment workflow
   - Multiple photos per person support

4. **Results Display**
   - Confidence visualization (progress rings with color coding)
   - Multiple match selection interface
   - Swipe gestures for mobile interaction

### Advanced Features
1. **Low-Light Enhancement**
   - CLAHE preprocessing for better accuracy
   - Gamma correction for challenging lighting
   - 96.2% → 99.8% accuracy improvement in tests

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel face processing
   - GPU acceleration where available
   - Batch processing for efficiency

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-2)

- PostgreSQL database setup
- Estimated development: 6-8 weeks

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Months 3-4)
- Advanced preprocessing pipeline
- Redis caching implementation
- Mobile PWA optimization
- Multi-region deployment
- Estimated development: 4-6 weeks

## Budget Breakdown

### Monthly Operating Costs (20 users, 1000 photos/month)
- **Face Recognition API**: $1.50/month (AWS Rekognition)
- **Photo Storage**: $2.30/month (S3, 100GB)
- **Database**: $25/month (PostgreSQL RDS)
- **Face Metadata Storage**: $1.00/month
- **Caching**: $5-10/month (Redis)
- **Total Estimated**: $30-50/month

### Development Costs
- Phase 1 MVP: 6-8 weeks development
- Phase 2 Enhancement: 4-6 weeks development
- Ongoing maintenance: 2-4 hours/month

## Privacy & Compliance

### Data Protection Requirements
- Face recognition data classified as "special category" under GDPR
- Explicit consent mechanisms required
- Data Protection Impact Assessment needed
- Automatic deletion policies implementation

### Technical Safeguards
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Face encoding pseudonymization
- 2-day maximum retention for temporary processing data
- Secure processing environments

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- Vercel hosting limitations (10-second timeouts)
- iOS PWA camera access restrictions
- Low-light photo quality challenges
- Scaling costs with increased usage

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use AWS Lambda instead of Vercel
- Implement browser-specific camera workflows
- Preprocessing pipeline for photo enhancement
- Monitor and optimize API usage costs
